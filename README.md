**NRT**: dataset consists of (Near Real-Time, Real-Time and Ultra Real-Time) data. [view details on RT and URT](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/firms/faq). Also explore our blog: [Wildfire detection in the US and Canada within a minute of satellite observation](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/FIRMS/2022/07/14/Wildfire+detection+in+the+US+and+Canada+within+a+minute+of+satellite+observation)

**SP**: Standard Processing; standard data products are an internally consistent, well-calibrated record of the Earthâ€™s geophysical properties to support science. There is a multi-month lag in this dataset availability. [more information on SP vs NRT](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/firms/faq)

# TODO
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/academy
- [x] Data Ingestion and Manipulation
- [x] Using FIRMS API
- [x] Data Visualization
- [x] Data Subsetting

- finish all of the FIRMS videos
- finish all of the ARES videos

### Fire Detection using FIRMS
- detect for fires using Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) bands
- Other bands are used for masking. rejection of false positives, etc 

### Typical Temperature Ranges
- Surface of the Earth: ~300K
- Smoldering Fires: 600K to 800K
- Flaming Fires: ~1000K+

### Fire Detection Algorithm

FIRST STAGE:
- exclusion of invalid data 
- masking of known water and cloud pixels 

SECOND STAGE (tentative):
- identify potential fire pixels
- background characterization
- threshold tests (non-fire // unknown)

THIRD STAGE (REJECTION TESTING):
- sub glint rejection

HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE REJECTION:
----------------------------------
// OVER LAND
- desert boundary rejection
- coast rejection
- forest cleaning rejection

// OVER WATER
- coast rejection
----------------------------------

OUTPUT: RASTER DATA IMAGE 
PIXEL SIZE is determined by the spatial resolution of the instrument onboard of the satellite

Pixel Elongation

Size of a pixel varies according to the spatial resolution of the sesnor onboard of the satellite 

### Data Latency
- delay between the observation and access to the data 
- wildfire events can be highly dynamic and vary rapidly over time

### Latency Terminology and Ranges
- URT (Ultra Real-Time): < 5min
- RT (Real-Time): 5min to 1hr
- NRT (Near Real-Time): 1hr to 3hrs
- Low Latency: 3hrs to 24hrs
- Expediated: 1 - 4 days 
- Standard Routine: 8 - 40 hrs <-- this is incredibly slow and should be a cause of concern

Satellite Observation -> Direct Broadcast -> SSEC Processing -> L2 URT Active Fire Processing 

Network of MODIS // VIIRS X-band ground stations network

### Landsat 8 / 9 
30m active fire processing data is posted within 30min
EROS processing center 
L2 Landsat Active Fire Detection / Processing

16 day orbit cycle / 8 day out of phase between the two satellites

### Real-Time Data 
GEOS-18 / GOES-19
10-15min latency

### Park Burn
Tends to occur in the afternoon and evening hours (18:00) for diurnal (daily) cycle

diurnal means daily cycle

### Atmospheric Factors impacting fire monitoring
- cloud cover
- smoke
- fog

### Biophysical Setting // Factors 
- forest canopy
- less forested areas
- terrain

Example: collision of cumulusj and pyrocumulus clouds effects a satellite's ability to detect fires

How can smoke from wildfires be detected during cloudly times?
NOAA 20 and NOAA 21 aerosol indices can be used to detect smoke plume. This data is coarse, so it might be difficult ot get the data during cloudy times

### RADAR Data 
- it has been used for mapping burned areas for cloudy areas within higher latitudes 
- ISAR mission (L-band SAR) to measure burned areas to find hazardour areas 

### Geostationary Data 
- be cautious when it is within use (only shows pixels with high amounts of confidence)
