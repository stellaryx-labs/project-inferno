### Fire Severity Classification
- Analyze fire images or sensor data to determine severity levels (low, medium, high)
- Use machine learning models for classification
- Provide confidence scores for predictions

### Thermal Signature Fingerprinting
- Capture and store unique thermal patterns of different fire types
- Compare real-time data to known signatures for identification
- Support for multiple sensor types (infrared, thermal cameras)

### Most Dangerous Fires
- Rank ongoing fires based on severity, spread rate, and proximity to assets

### Predictive Fire Spread Estimator
- Model fire spread using weather, terrain, and fuel data
- Visualize predicted fire paths on maps
