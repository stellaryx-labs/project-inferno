# TODO
- fix date time error in the code 
- make each satellite marker a different color 
- add a day/night toggle to the map
- add a color magnitude / richensss display onto the map

make an intensity toggle: FRP
make a brightness / temp toggle: Bright_ti4, Bright_ti5

look into adding map richness / intensity display... like changing the GIS layers for each of the following

Look into the following:
- Bright_ti4: VIIRS I-4 channel brightness temperature of the fire pixel measured in Kelvin
- Bright_ti5: VIIRS I-5 channel brightness temperature of the fire pixel measured in Kelvin
- FRP (Fire Radiative Power): Fire Radiative Power in MW
